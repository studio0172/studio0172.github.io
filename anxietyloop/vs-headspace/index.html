        <h2>Two Different Philosophies</h2>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>🎯 Anxiety Loop: Track and Understand</h3>
            <p>Anxiety Loop exists to answer one question: <strong>what's actually happening with my anxiety?</strong></p>
            <p>The app takes about 2 seconds to use. Open it, tap your current state, done. Over weeks and months, you build a picture of your patterns. Maybe you notice anxiety spikes before meetings. Maybe weekends are harder than weekdays. Maybe there's a rhythm you never noticed.</p>
            <p>That awareness is the point. Anxiety Loop combines pattern tracking with guided audio exercises for relief—understand your anxiety AND have tools to calm it. Once you see your patterns, you know when to use those tools.</p>
            <p>Everything stays on your phone. No account, no servers, no cloud. Your mental health data belongs to you and only you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>🧘 Headspace: The Meditation Pioneer</h3>
            <p>Headspace popularized meditation for the modern smartphone era. Founded by former Buddhist monk Andy Puddicombe in 2010, it's helped millions learn to meditate through friendly, accessible guided sessions.</p>
            <p>The philosophy is simple: <strong>regular meditation practice makes you calmer, more focused, and better equipped to handle anxiety.</strong> Headspace provides the structure and guidance to build that practice.</p>
            <p>You get hundreds of guided meditations, anxiety-specific courses, sleep content called "Sleepcasts," focus music, breathing exercises, and even mental health coaching. It's comprehensive—almost like having a meditation teacher in your pocket.</p>
            <p>The approach requires time investment. Most sessions run 5-20 minutes. The benefits come from consistency—meditating regularly over weeks and months.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Feature Breakdown</h2>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>📊 Tracking Anxiety Patterns</h3>
            <p><strong>Anxiety Loop</strong> is built specifically for tracking. The simple 4-level system (Calm, Elevated, Anxious, Overwhelmed) captures your state without overthinking. The weekly and monthly views show your trends clearly. You can spot patterns, correlate with life events, and see whether your anxiety is trending up or down over time.</p>
            <p><strong>Headspace</strong> doesn't track anxiety. It tracks your meditation streak and total minutes meditated—metrics about your practice, not your mental state. There's no way to log how you're feeling or visualize patterns over time.</p>
            <p><em>Winner: Anxiety Loop</em> — if understanding your anxiety patterns matters to you, this is the clear choice.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>🧘 Meditation Content</h3>
            <p><strong>Headspace</strong> shines here. Hundreds of guided meditations covering anxiety, stress, focus, sleep, self-esteem, relationships, and more. The content is expertly produced with Andy Puddicombe's warm, approachable voice guiding most sessions. New content added regularly. Specific courses help you build skills progressively over multiple days or weeks.</p>
            <p><strong>Anxiety Loop</strong> includes guided exercises with calming audio, focused specifically on anxiety relief. It's a curated toolbox rather than a content library—everything is there for a purpose, nothing feels like filler.</p>
            <p><em>Winner: Headspace</em> — for sheer depth and variety of meditation content, Headspace is hard to beat.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>😴 Sleep Support</h3>
            <p><strong>Headspace</strong> invented "Sleepcasts"—audio experiences designed to help you drift off. Part ambient soundscape, part gentle storytelling. They're creative and genuinely effective for many people. Plus sleep music, wind-down meditations, and sleep sounds.</p>
            <p><strong>Anxiety Loop</strong> offers calming audio for relaxation but doesn't have dedicated sleep features. You could track whether your anxiety affects your sleep, but the app doesn't address sleep directly.</p>
            <p><em>Winner: Headspace</em> — for sleep issues, Headspace has put serious work into this area.</p>

            <h3>🔒 Privacy</h3>
            <p><strong>Anxiety Loop</strong> stores everything locally. No account creation, no data leaving your device, no servers. Your anxiety data is genuinely private—the company literally can't access it because it doesn't exist anywhere but your phone.</p>
            <p><strong>Headspace</strong> requires an account. Your meditation history, progress, preferences, and activity are synced to their servers. This enables cross-device access and personalization, but your data does live on their systems. Standard for subscription apps, but worth knowing.</p>
            <p><em>Winner: Anxiety Loop</em> — the privacy difference is structural and significant.</p>

            <h3>⏱️ Time Investment</h3>
            <p><strong>Anxiety Loop:</strong> 2 seconds. Open, tap, done. Check your patterns when you're curious. The app respects that you have a life outside of managing anxiety.</p>
            <p><strong>Headspace:</strong> Designed for daily meditation sessions of 5-20+ minutes. The "Basics" course alone is 10 sessions. Anxiety-specific courses span multiple weeks. Headspace wants significant daily time—that's how meditation works.</p>
            <p><em>Winner:</em> Depends on your goals. <em>Anxiety Loop</em> for minimal time. <em>Headspace</em> if you're ready to commit to a practice.</p>

            <h3>📱 Anxiety-Specific Content</h3>
            <p><strong>Headspace</strong> has dedicated anxiety courses like "Managing Anxiety" that teach meditation techniques specifically for anxious minds. You learn to observe anxious thoughts without getting caught up in them. The content is evidence-based and well-designed.</p>
            <p><strong>Anxiety Loop's</strong> guided exercises are built for in-the-moment anxiety relief—breathing techniques, calming audio, quick interventions when you're feeling overwhelmed. Less educational, more immediately practical.</p>
            <p><em>Winner: Tie</em> — different strengths. Headspace teaches you skills over time. Anxiety Loop provides quick relief and awareness.</p>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>🎯 Coaching</h3>
            <p><strong>Headspace</strong> now offers mental health coaching—connecting you with a real human coach for personalized support. It's an add-on service but represents Headspace's expansion beyond content into actual care.</p>
            <p><strong>Anxiety Loop</strong> doesn't offer coaching. It's a tool, not a service. You'd need to find coaching or therapy elsewhere.</p>
            <p><em>Winner: Headspace</em> — if you want human support, Headspace provides an option.</p>

            <h3>Our Honest Take</h3>
            <p>Anxiety Loop and Headspace solve different problems with different philosophies.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 16px;"><strong>Headspace</strong> teaches you meditation. It's one of the best apps for learning to meditate, with years of refined content and Andy Puddicombe's genuinely helpful guidance. If you want to build a meditation practice and have the time and budget, Headspace delivers. The anxiety courses are solid, the sleep content is creative, and the overall experience is polished.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 16px;"><strong>Anxiety Loop</strong> combines tracking with guided exercises. You log your state, see your patterns, and use built-in audio tools for relief when anxiety hits. It's focused specifically on anxiety rather than general mindfulness. And it takes almost no time.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 16px;">Here's what we've seen: <strong>many people use both</strong>. Track your anxiety with Anxiety Loop to understand your patterns.

            <p style="margin-top: 16px;">If you're budget-conscious: Anxiety Loop's core tracking is free, and the upgrade is a one-time purchase. Headspace requires an ongoing subscription that adds up over time.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 16px;">If privacy matters: Anxiety Loop keeps everything on your device. Headspace requires an account and stores your data on their servers.</p>
