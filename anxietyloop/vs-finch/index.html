        <h2>Two Different Philosophies</h2>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>🎯 Anxiety Loop: Data-Driven Awareness</h3>
            <p>Anxiety Loop is built on a simple premise: <strong>awareness leads to change</strong>. By tracking your anxiety levels over time, you start noticing patterns. Maybe Mondays are always hard. Maybe anxiety spikes after certain activities. Maybe you're actually calmer than you thought.</p>
            <p>The app stays out of your way. One tap to check in, breathing exercises when you need them, clear charts to see your patterns. No pets, no streaks, no gamification. Just data about how you're actually feeling.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>🐦 Finch: Motivation Through Care</h3>
            <p>Finch takes a completely different approach: <strong>caring for something else helps you care for yourself</strong>. You raise a virtual bird that grows and goes on adventures based on the self-care activities you complete.</p>
            <p>It's clever psychology. When you don't feel like drinking water or taking a walk, doing it "for your Finch" can provide that extra push. The app includes journaling, breathing exercises, goal-setting, and a social component where friends can send encouraging messages.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Feature Breakdown</h2>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>🔒 Privacy: A Fundamental Difference</h3>
            <p><strong>Anxiety Loop</strong> stores everything on your device. No account, no servers, no cloud. Your anxiety data never leaves your phone. This is a core design principle, not just a feature.</p>
            <p><strong>Finch</strong> requires an account because pet progression needs to be saved server-side. Your activity data, journal entries, and social connections are stored on Finch's servers. They have a privacy policy, but your data does leave your device.</p>
            <p><em>Winner: Anxiety Loop</em> — for privacy-conscious users, this isn't close.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>⏱️ Daily Interaction</h3>
            <p><strong>Anxiety Loop:</strong> 2 seconds. Open app, tap anxiety level, done. Optional breathing exercises if you need them. The app respects your time.</p>
            <p><strong>Finch:</strong> More engaging but more time-consuming. Check on your pet, set daily goals, complete activities, read reflections, maybe chat with friends. Could be 5-15 minutes depending on engagement.</p>
            <p><em>Winner:</em> Depends. <em>Anxiety Loop</em> for minimal friction. <em>Finch</em> if you want a more immersive daily ritual.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>🌬️ In-The-Moment Help</h3>
            <p>Both apps offer breathing exercises for acute anxiety moments. <strong>Anxiety Loop's</strong> breathing feature is prominently accessible — designed for when anxiety spikes and you need immediate help.</p>
            <p><strong>Finch</strong> includes breathing and grounding exercises too, plus journaling prompts and soundscapes. More variety, but slightly more navigation to access during a panic moment.</p>
            <p><em>Winner: Tie</em> — both provide calming tools, slightly different approaches.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>📊 Understanding Your Patterns</h3>
            <p><strong>Anxiety Loop</strong> is built specifically for pattern recognition. Weekly and monthly views show exactly when your anxiety tends to spike. The simple 4-level system (Calm, Elevated, Anxious, Overwhelmed) makes trends easy to spot.</p>
            <p><strong>Finch</strong> tracks completed activities and has reflection features, but pattern analysis isn't its core strength. You'll know what self-care you did, but not necessarily how your anxiety changed over time.</p>
            <p><em>Winner: Anxiety Loop</em> — if understanding your anxiety patterns is the goal.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>🎮 Motivation & Consistency</h3>
            <p><strong>Finch</strong> excels here. The pet mechanic genuinely works for many people. Watching your bird grow, unlock outfits, and go on adventures creates a motivation loop that pure tracking apps can't match.</p>
            <p><strong>Anxiety Loop</strong> has no gamification by design. If you need external motivation to track, this might be a weakness. If you find gamification distracting or patronizing, it's a strength.</p>
            <p><em>Winner: Finch</em> — for users who benefit from gamified motivation.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Pricing Comparison</h2>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>💰 What You Pay</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Anxiety Loop Free:</strong> Core tracking is free—one-tap check-ins, basic trends, no ads.</li>
                <li><strong>Anxiety Loop Pro:</strong> $19.99 one-time unlocks detailed patterns and guided exercises. No subscription.</li>
                <li><strong>Finch Free:</strong> Core features available — pet care, basic self-care tools, limited adventures.</li>
                <li><strong>Finch Plus:</strong> $54.99/year — unlimited adventures, expanded wardrobe, additional features.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Finch's free tier is functional, but the premium experience is significantly richer. Anxiety Loop gives you everything upfront.</p>

            <h3>Our Honest Take</h3>
            <p>These apps solve different problems and can actually complement each other.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 16px;"><strong>Finch</strong> is brilliant for people who struggle with self-care motivation. The pet mechanic is genuinely effective psychology, not just a gimmick. If you know what you should do but struggle to do it, Finch might provide that push.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 16px;"><strong>Anxiety Loop</strong> is for people who want to understand their anxiety, not just manage it. The simple tracking creates awareness that leads to insight. Many users discover patterns they never noticed — "I'm always anxious on Sundays" or "my anxiety dropped after I started walking."</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 16px;">If privacy matters to you, Anxiety Loop is the clear choice. If motivation is your struggle, Finch might help more. Some people use both — Finch for daily self-care motivation, Anxiety Loop specifically for anxiety awareness.</p>
