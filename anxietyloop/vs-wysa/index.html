        <h2>Two Different Approaches</h2>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>🎯 Anxiety Loop: Track and Understand</h3>
            <p>Anxiety Loop answers one question: <strong>what's actually happening with my anxiety?</strong></p>
            <p>The app takes about 2 seconds to use. Open it, tap your current state, done. Over weeks and months, you build a clear picture of your patterns. Maybe Monday mornings spike your anxiety. Maybe you're calmer on days you exercise. Maybe there's a weekly rhythm you never noticed.</p>
            <p>That awareness is the foundation. When you see your patterns clearly, you know when to reach for coping tools—and you can measure whether they're actually working.</p>
            <p>Everything stays on your phone. No account, no servers, no cloud. Your mental health data is genuinely yours.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>🐧 Wysa: Your AI Mental Health Companion</h3>
            <p>Wysa takes a comprehensive approach. It's an AI chatbot trained to deliver evidence-based therapeutic techniques through warm, supportive conversations. Think of it as <strong>a pocket companion that's always there when you need to talk</strong>.</p>
            <p>The AI (represented by a friendly penguin) uses Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), mindfulness, and other techniques. You chat about how you're feeling, and Wysa guides you through exercises tailored to your situation. Struggling with negative thoughts? It helps you identify and reframe them. Can't sleep? It offers sleep stories and relaxation exercises.</p>
            <p>Wysa was developed with input from clinical psychologists and has published research demonstrating its effectiveness for anxiety and depression. It's been recognized by the NHS and ORCHA for its clinical credibility.</p>
            <p>For users who want more, premium subscriptions unlock additional content and the option to text with human mental health coaches. This bridges the gap between self-help and professional therapy.</p>

        <h2>Feature Breakdown</h2>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>📊 Tracking Anxiety Patterns</h3>
            <p><strong>Anxiety Loop</strong> is built specifically for tracking. The simple 4-level system (Calm, Elevated, Anxious, Overwhelmed) captures your state without overthinking. The weekly and monthly views show your trends clearly. You can spot patterns, correlate with life events, and see whether your anxiety is improving over time.</p>
            <p><strong>Wysa</strong> includes mood check-ins within its conversational flow, but tracking isn't its primary function. You can see your mood history, but it's not designed for detailed pattern analysis. The focus is on addressing what's happening now through conversation, not building a comprehensive historical record.</p>
            <p><em>Winner: Anxiety Loop</em> — if understanding your patterns over time is the goal, Anxiety Loop is purpose-built for this.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>🧠 Therapeutic Techniques</h3>
            <p><strong>Wysa</strong> excels here. It delivers multiple evidence-based approaches through its AI chatbot:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>CBT:</strong> Identify negative thought patterns, cognitive distortions, and reframe thinking</li>
                <li><strong>DBT:</strong> Distress tolerance, emotional regulation, and mindfulness skills</li>
                <li><strong>Mindfulness:</strong> Guided meditations, breathing exercises, body scans</li>
                <li><strong>Sleep tools:</strong> Sleep stories, relaxation exercises, sleep hygiene guidance</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The techniques are real—the same ones therapists use. The AI delivers them accessibly when you need them most.</p>
            <p><strong>Anxiety Loop</strong> includes guided breathing exercises for immediate relief, but doesn't attempt to deliver therapy. It's a tool for awareness, not intervention.</p>
            <p><em>Winner: Wysa</em> — for learning and practicing therapeutic techniques, Wysa offers a comprehensive toolkit.</p>

            <h3>⏱️ Time Investment</h3>
            <p><strong>Anxiety Loop:</strong> 2 seconds. Open, tap, done. Check your patterns when you're curious. The app respects that you have a life outside of managing anxiety.</p>
            <p><strong>Wysa:</strong> Designed for deeper engagement. A conversation might take 5-20 minutes depending on what you need. Exercises and meditations add more time. The therapeutic value comes from actually engaging—skimming through won't help.</p>
            <p><em>Winner:</em> Depends on your needs. <em>Anxiety Loop</em> for minimal daily time. <em>Wysa</em> when you need deeper support and have time to engage.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>🔒 Privacy</h3>
            <p><strong>Anxiety Loop</strong> stores everything locally. No account creation, no data leaving your device, no servers. Your anxiety data is genuinely private—the company literally can't access it because it doesn't exist anywhere but your phone.</p>
            <p><strong>Wysa</strong> requires an account and stores conversation data on their servers. They're HIPAA-compliant and take privacy seriously—conversations are encrypted and anonymized. But your mental health conversations do exist outside your device. This enables AI improvements and coach access, but represents a fundamentally different privacy model.</p>
            <p><em>Winner: Anxiety Loop</em> — the privacy difference is structural. On-device only vs. cloud-based.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>🆘 Crisis Support</h3>
            <p><strong>Wysa</strong> includes crisis resources and can detect when users might be in distress, offering appropriate resources and helpline information. The human coach option provides another layer of support for difficult moments.</p>
            <p><strong>Anxiety Loop</strong> is not designed for crisis support. It's a tracking tool, not an intervention. For acute anxiety or crisis situations, you need different resources.</p>
            <p><em>Winner: Wysa</em> — for moments when you need more than tracking, Wysa offers real-time support and crisis resources.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>📱 Ease of Use</h3>
            <p><strong>Anxiety Loop's</strong> one-tap interface is about as simple as it gets. No learning curve. No conversation to navigate. Just tap how you feel and you're done. The barrier to daily tracking is almost zero.</p>
            <p><strong>Wysa</strong> is friendly and conversational, but requires active engagement. You need to read, respond, and participate. The penguin mascot makes it approachable, but it's inherently more involved than a simple tracker.</p>
            <p><em>Winner: Anxiety Loop</em> — for sheer ease of daily use, nothing beats one tap.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>🔬 Research and Evidence</h3>
            <p><strong>Wysa</strong> has strong clinical backing. It's been evaluated in randomized controlled trials showing effectiveness for anxiety and depression. It's received recognition from healthcare organizations including the NHS, and is certified by ORCHA (Organisation for the Review of Care and Health Apps). The techniques it uses are all evidence-based.</p>
            <p><strong>Anxiety Loop</strong> is built on evidence-based principles (tracking and self-awareness are proven helpful for anxiety management), but doesn't have dedicated clinical trials on the app itself.</p>
            <p><em>Winner: Wysa</em> — for research-backed credibility, Wysa has the clinical validation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>👤 Human Support</h3>
            <p><strong>Wysa Premium</strong> offers access to human mental health coaches. These aren't therapists, but trained professionals who can provide personalized guidance via text. This bridges the gap between an AI app and professional therapy.</p>
            <p><strong>Anxiety Loop</strong> is purely a self-tracking tool. No human support is offered.</p>
            <p><em>Winner: Wysa</em> — for those who want some human connection, Wysa's coach option is unique.</p>

            <h3>Our Honest Take</h3>
            <p>Anxiety Loop and Wysa serve fundamentally different needs—they're complements, not competitors.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 16px;"><strong>Wysa</strong> is like a supportive friend who's always available, trained in therapeutic techniques. It teaches you skills, guides you through difficult moments, and provides warmth when anxiety feels isolating. The research backing it is solid. The catch is time—you need to actually engage with conversations and exercises to benefit. For people who want accessible therapy tools without the cost or scheduling of real therapy, Wysa delivers genuine value.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 16px;"><strong>Anxiety Loop</strong> is like a health tracker for your mind. It doesn't try to fix your anxiety—it helps you understand it. Two seconds, once or twice a day, builds a picture of your patterns that no conversation can provide. That awareness lets you see what triggers you, what helps, and whether things are getting better or worse.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 16px;">The most powerful approach? <strong>Use both</strong>. Track your patterns with Anxiety Loop to understand when and why anxiety hits. Use Wysa to learn and practice coping techniques when you have the time. Awareness (patterns) plus skills (therapeutic tools) is more powerful than either alone.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 16px;">If privacy is non-negotiable: Anxiety Loop keeps everything on your device. Period.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 16px;">If you want therapy techniques: Wysa delivers real CBT, DBT, and mindfulness through an accessible format.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 16px;">If time is scarce: Anxiety Loop takes 2 seconds. Wysa needs 10+ minutes.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 16px;">If you want someone to talk to: Wysa's AI (and optional human coaches) provides that connection.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 16px;">If you want data: Anxiety Loop visualizes your patterns clearly.</p>
