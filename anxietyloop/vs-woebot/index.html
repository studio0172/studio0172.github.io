        <h2>Two Different Philosophies</h2>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>🎯 Anxiety Loop: Track and Understand</h3>
            <p>Anxiety Loop exists to answer one question: <strong>what's actually happening with my anxiety?</strong></p>
            <p>The app takes about 2 seconds to use. Open it, tap your current state, done. Over weeks and months, you build a picture of your patterns. Maybe you notice anxiety spikes before meetings. Maybe weekends are harder than weekdays. Maybe there's a rhythm you never noticed.</p>
            <p>That awareness is the point. When you see your patterns clearly, you know when to reach for coping tools—and you can measure whether they're working.</p>
            <p>Everything stays on your phone. No account, no servers, no cloud. Your mental health data belongs to you and only you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>🤖 Woebot: Your AI Therapist</h3>
            <p>Woebot takes a completely different approach. It's an AI chatbot trained to deliver Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) through text conversations. Think of it as <strong>having a pocket therapist available 24/7</strong>.</p>
            <p>You chat with Woebot about how you're feeling, and it guides you through evidence-based CBT techniques. It helps you identify negative thought patterns, challenge cognitive distortions, and reframe anxious thinking. The experience is conversational and feels surprisingly natural for an AI.</p>
            <p>Woebot was created by psychologists at Stanford and has published peer-reviewed research showing effectiveness. It's not a replacement for human therapy, but it makes therapeutic techniques accessible when you can't see a therapist—at 2am, on a Sunday, whenever anxiety hits.</p>
            <p>The catch: it requires engagement. A Woebot session takes 5-15 minutes of active conversation. You get out what you put in.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Feature Breakdown</h2>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>📊 Tracking Anxiety Patterns</h3>
            <p><strong>Anxiety Loop</strong> is built specifically for tracking. The simple 4-level system (Calm, Elevated, Anxious, Overwhelmed) captures your state without overthinking. The weekly and monthly views show your trends clearly. You can spot patterns, correlate with life events, and see whether your anxiety is trending up or down over time.</p>
            <p><strong>Woebot</strong> does check in on your mood during conversations, but it's not designed as a tracking tool. You won't get visualizations of your patterns over weeks or months. The focus is on addressing what's happening right now through conversation, not building a historical record.</p>
            <p><em>Winner: Anxiety Loop</em> — if understanding your patterns over time is the goal, Anxiety Loop is purpose-built for this.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>🧠 CBT and Therapeutic Techniques</h3>
            <p><strong>Woebot</strong> shines here. It's essentially a CBT delivery system wrapped in an AI chatbot. You learn to identify cognitive distortions (catastrophizing, black-and-white thinking, mind reading), challenge automatic negative thoughts, and develop healthier thinking patterns. The techniques are real—the same ones a therapist would teach you.</p>
            <p><strong>Anxiety Loop</strong> includes guided calming exercises and breathing techniques but doesn't attempt to deliver therapy. It's a tool for awareness, not intervention.</p>
            <p><em>Winner: Woebot</em> — for actual therapeutic techniques and CBT learning, Woebot is the clear choice.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>⏱️ Time Investment</h3>
            <p><strong>Anxiety Loop:</strong> 2 seconds. Open, tap, done. Check your patterns when you're curious. The app respects that you have a life outside of managing anxiety.</p>
            <p><strong>Woebot:</strong> Designed for daily conversations of 5-15 minutes. The therapeutic value comes from actually engaging with the exercises and thought challenges. Skim through and you won't benefit. Engage deeply and it can genuinely help.</p>
            <p><em>Winner:</em> Depends on your goals. <em>Anxiety Loop</em> for minimal time. <em>Woebot</em> if you want to put in the work for therapeutic benefit.</p>

            <h3>🔒 Privacy</h3>
            <p><strong>Anxiety Loop</strong> stores everything locally. No account creation, no data leaving your device, no servers. Your anxiety data is genuinely private—the company literally can't access it because it doesn't exist anywhere but your phone.</p>
            <p><strong>Woebot</strong> requires an account. Your conversations with the AI are stored on their servers. This enables the AI to remember context from previous sessions and improve the experience, but your mental health conversations do live on external servers. Woebot is HIPAA-compliant, but the data exists outside your device.</p>
            <p><em>Winner: Anxiety Loop</em> — the privacy difference is structural and significant for mental health data.</p>

            <h3>📱 Ease of Use</h3>
            <p><strong>Anxiety Loop's</strong> one-tap interface is about as simple as it gets. No learning curve. No conversation to navigate. Just tap how you feel and you're done. The barrier to daily tracking is almost zero.</p>
            <p><strong>Woebot</strong> requires active engagement. You need to read, respond, and participate in the conversation. For some people, this interactive experience is helpful—it feels like you're actually doing something. For others, it's friction that prevents daily use.</p>
            <p><em>Winner: Anxiety Loop</em> — for sheer ease of daily use, nothing beats one tap.</p>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>🔬 Research and Evidence</h3>
            <p><strong>Woebot</strong> has an edge here. The company was founded by clinical psychologists from Stanford and has published peer-reviewed research demonstrating that using Woebot can reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. It's one of the few mental health apps with actual clinical trials backing its effectiveness.</p>
            <p><strong>Anxiety Loop</strong> is built on evidence-based principles (tracking and awareness are proven helpful for anxiety management), but doesn't have dedicated clinical research on the app itself.</p>
            <p><em>Winner: Woebot</em> — for research-backed credibility, Woebot has the published studies.</p>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>🚨 In-the-Moment Help</h3>
            <p><strong>Woebot</strong> can help you work through an anxious moment in real-time. Having a panic attack? Open Woebot and it'll guide you through coping techniques. The conversational format makes it feel less lonely when anxiety hits hard.</p>
            <p><strong>Anxiety Loop</strong> includes breathing exercises and calming audio for immediate relief, but the primary value is the long-term pattern tracking. It helps you understand your anxiety; it's not designed as a crisis intervention tool.</p>
            <p><em>Winner: Woebot</em> — for real-time support during anxious moments, the chatbot format provides more guidance.</p>

            <h3>Our Honest Take</h3>
            <p>Anxiety Loop and Woebot serve genuinely different purposes—they're not really competitors, they're complements.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 16px;"><strong>Woebot</strong> is like a pocket therapist. It teaches you CBT skills, helps you work through anxious moments, and provides company when anxiety feels lonely. The research backing it is real. The catch is time—you need to invest 10-15 minutes of active conversation to get value. For people who want to learn coping skills but can't access regular therapy, Woebot fills a genuine gap.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 16px;"><strong>Anxiety Loop</strong> is like a health tracker for your mind. It doesn't try to fix your anxiety—it helps you understand it. Two seconds, once or twice a day, builds a picture of your patterns that no conversation can provide. That awareness lets you see what triggers you, what helps, and whether you're getting better or worse over time.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 16px;">Here's what makes sense: <strong>use both</strong>. Track your patterns with Anxiety Loop to understand when and why anxiety hits. Use Woebot to learn and practice CBT techniques when you have the time. The combination of awareness (patterns) plus skills (CBT) is more powerful than either alone.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 16px;">If privacy is non-negotiable: Anxiety Loop keeps everything on your device. Full stop.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 16px;">If you want therapy techniques: Woebot delivers real CBT through an accessible format.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 16px;">If time is scarce: Anxiety Loop takes 2 seconds. Woebot needs 10+ minutes.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 16px;">If you want to talk it out: Woebot's conversational approach feels less lonely.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 16px;">If you want data: Anxiety Loop visualizes your patterns clearly.</p>
