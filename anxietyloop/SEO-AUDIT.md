## What's Working Well

## Recommendations (Low Priority)

### 1. Add Schema Markup
Consider adding:
- `SoftwareApplication` schema on main page
- `Article` schema on blog posts
- `FAQPage` schema where applicable

### 2. Internal Linking
Ensure all comparison pages link to:
- Main anxiety-loop page
- Related blog posts (morning-anxiety, sunday-scaries, etc.)
- 7-day-challenge CTA

### 3. Image Optimization
Verify all images have:
- Descriptive alt tags
- WebP format for faster loading
- Compressed file sizes

### 4. H1 Tags
Verify each page has exactly one H1 that matches the title intent.
