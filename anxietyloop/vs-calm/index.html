        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>🎯 Anxiety Loop: Track and Understand</h3>
            <p>Anxiety Loop answers a simple question: <strong>what's actually happening with my anxiety?</strong></p>
            <p>Open the app. Tap how you're feeling. Over time, you see patterns. Maybe your anxiety spikes on Mondays. Maybe it's worse after certain activities or situations. Maybe it follows a rhythm you never noticed.</p>
            <p>That's Anxiety Loop's entire purpose—helping you see your patterns clearly so you can understand what's going on. No content library, no subscriptions, no account. Just a clean tool for awareness.</p>
            <p>Everything stays on your device. No cloud. No data mining. Just you and your data.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>🧘 Calm: The Meditation Empire</h3>
            <p>Calm is a <strong>content platform for relaxation</strong>. Think of it like Netflix for your nervous system.</p>
            <p>You get hundreds of guided meditations, sleep stories narrated by celebrities (Matthew McConaughey reading bedtime stories, anyone?), focus music, breathing exercises, masterclass videos from experts, and a new "Daily Calm" meditation each day.</p>
            <p>Calm has won app awards, runs Super Bowl commercials, and has become a household name in wellness. It's polished, professional, and comprehensive.</p>
            <p>The philosophy: regular meditation and relaxation content will help reduce anxiety over time. Consume calming content, feel calmer. Simple in theory, powerful when practiced.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Feature Breakdown</h2>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>📊 Actually Tracking Anxiety</h3>
            <p><strong>Anxiety Loop</strong> is built specifically for tracking. The simple 4-level system (Calm, Elevated, Anxious, Overwhelmed) captures your state without overthinking. Weekly and monthly views show your trends at a glance. You can actually see whether things are getting better, worse, or following patterns.</p>
            <p><strong>Calm</strong> has a "How are you feeling?" check-in, but it's not the focus. Calm wants you meditating, not analyzing data. There's no meaningful trend visualization or pattern analysis. The mood feature feels like an afterthought because, well, it is one.</p>
            <p><em>Winner: Anxiety Loop</em> — if tracking and understanding patterns matters to you, this isn't close.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>🧘 Meditation and Guided Content</h3>
            <p><strong>Calm</strong> has one of the largest meditation libraries in any app. Hundreds of guided sessions for anxiety, stress, focus, sleep, gratitude, self-compassion, and more. Content ranges from 3-minute quick sessions to 30+ minute deep dives. New content added regularly.</p>
            <p><strong>Anxiety Loop</strong> includes guided exercises with calming audio—focused on anxiety relief rather than general meditation. It's a curated set of tools, not a content library. More focused, less overwhelming.</p>
            <p><em>Winner: Calm</em> — for sheer volume and variety of meditation content, Calm wins. But Anxiety Loop's focused approach works better for some.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>😴 Sleep Support</h3>
            <p><strong>Calm</strong> is famous for Sleep Stories—adult bedtime stories designed to help you drift off. They're narrated by celebrities and professional voice actors. There's also sleep music, soundscapes, and sleep meditations. Calm takes sleep seriously.</p>
            <p><strong>Anxiety Loop</strong> doesn't address sleep directly. You could track how your anxiety relates to sleep patterns, but the app doesn't offer sleep-specific features.</p>
            <p><em>Winner: Calm</em> — for sleep issues, Calm has an entire product category that Anxiety Loop doesn't touch.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>🔒 Privacy</h3>
            <p><strong>Anxiety Loop</strong> stores everything locally on your device. No account creation, no servers, no cloud sync. Your anxiety data is genuinely private—it never leaves your phone.</p>
            <p><strong>Calm</strong> requires an account. Your listening history, preferences, and activity are stored on their servers. They need this for personalization and cross-device sync. Standard for subscription apps, but your wellness data does exist in their systems.</p>
            <p><em>Winner: Anxiety Loop</em> — for privacy-conscious users, the difference is structural.</p>

            <h3>⏱️ Time Investment</h3>
            <p><strong>Anxiety Loop:</strong> 2 seconds. Open, tap, done. Check your trends when curious. The app asks almost nothing from you.</p>
            <p><strong>Calm:</strong> Designed for 10-20+ minute sessions. The Daily Calm is about 10 minutes. Sleep stories run 30-45 minutes. Calm wants significant daily time. That's the point—meditation takes time to work.</p>
            <p><em>Winner:</em> Depends on your goals. <em>Anxiety Loop</em> for minimal time investment. <em>Calm</em> if you're ready to commit to a meditation practice.</p>

            <p><strong>Anxiety Loop</strong> includes guided exercises with audio instruction—practical tools you learn by doing. It's focused on anxiety relief techniques rather than broad educational content.</p>
            <p><em>Winner: Calm</em> — for learning about anxiety and mental health, Calm provides actual education.</p>

        <h2>Pricing Reality</h2>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>💰 What You Actually Pay</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Anxiety Loop Free:</strong> Core tracking is free—one-tap check-ins, basic trends, no ads.</li>
                <li><strong>Anxiety Loop Pro:</strong> $19.99 one-time unlocks detailed patterns and guided exercises. No subscription.</li>
                <li><strong>Calm Free:</strong> Very limited. Some breathing exercises, limited sleep content, a few meditations. More like a demo than a usable app.</li>
                <li><strong>Calm Premium:</strong> $69.99/year or $14.99/month — unlocks everything.</li>
                <li><strong>Calm Lifetime:</strong> $399.99 one-time — all features forever.</li>
                <li><strong>Calm Family:</strong> $99.99/year — up to 6 family members.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Calm's free tier is frustratingly limited. The app pushes you toward premium constantly. The full Calm experience requires ongoing subscription payments.</p>
            <p>Anxiety Loop's free tier is genuinely useful on its own. And if you upgrade, it's a one-time purchase—no recurring fees, no subscription fatigue.</p>

            <h3>Our Honest Take</h3>
            <p>Anxiety Loop and Calm aren't really competing—they're solving different problems.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 16px;"><strong>Calm</strong> is a meditation and sleep content platform. It's polished, comprehensive, and proven effective for millions. If you want guided meditation, sleep stories, and relaxation content, Calm delivers. It's one of the best in its category. You're paying for a content library, and the content is genuinely good.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 16px;"><strong>Anxiety Loop</strong> is a focused tracking tool. It doesn't compete with Calm's content—it doesn't try to. Instead, it helps you understand your anxiety patterns through simple, private logging. That's valuable in a completely different way.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 16px;">Here's the thing: <strong>many people use both</strong>. Track your anxiety with Anxiety Loop. Meditate with Calm (or Headspace, or whatever). They complement each other perfectly.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 16px;">If budget matters: Anxiety Loop's core tracking is free, and the pro upgrade is a one-time purchase. Calm requires an ongoing subscription—$70/year adds up over time.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 16px;">If privacy matters: Anxiety Loop keeps everything on your device. Calm requires an account and stores your data. Not a criticism of Calm—it's how subscription apps work—but it's a real difference.</p>
