        <h2>Two Different Scales</h2>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>🎯 Anxiety Loop: Focused Simplicity</h3>
            <p>Anxiety Loop does one thing well: <strong>help you understand your anxiety patterns</strong>. Open the app, tap how you're feeling, see your trends over time. When anxiety spikes, use the built-in breathing exercises to calm down.</p>
            <p>That's it. No lessons, no community, no therapy integration. Just a clean, private tool for tracking and awareness. Everything stays on your device—no account, no cloud, no data leaving your phone.</p>
            <p>The philosophy: awareness leads to change. When you see patterns, you start understanding what triggers you and what helps.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>🏥 Sanvello: Comprehensive Mental Health</h3>
            <p>Sanvello (formerly Pacifica) is a <strong>full mental health platform</strong>. It includes mood tracking, but that's just the beginning. The app offers CBT-based thought exercises, guided audio journeys, meditation, a peer community, journaling, goal-setting, and even access to licensed therapists and coaches.</p>
            <p>It's designed to be a one-stop mental health solution—like having a therapist, meditation app, journal, and community all in one place. For some people, this integration is exactly what they need.</p>
            <p>The tradeoff: you need an account, your data lives on their servers, and the full experience requires a subscription.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Feature Breakdown</h2>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>🔒 Privacy: A Core Difference</h3>
            <p><strong>Anxiety Loop</strong> stores everything locally on your device. No account creation, no servers, no cloud sync. Your anxiety data never leaves your phone. This isn't just a feature—it's a core design principle.</p>
            <p><strong>Sanvello</strong> requires an account and stores data on their servers. This is necessary for features like therapy access, community participation, and syncing across devices. They have privacy policies, but your mental health data does exist on external servers.</p>
            <p><em>Winner: Anxiety Loop</em> — for privacy-conscious users, the difference is fundamental.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>🧠 CBT and Therapeutic Tools</h3>
            <p><strong>Sanvello</strong> shines here. The app includes cognitive behavioral therapy exercises—like identifying and challenging anxious thoughts. There are guided audio lessons on topics like managing worry, improving sleep, and building resilience. It's essentially CBT-lite in your pocket.</p>
            <p><strong>Anxiety Loop</strong> includes guided audio exercises for anxiety relief—breathing techniques, calming sessions, and relaxation tools. It's focused specifically on anxiety rather than offering the broad CBT curriculum Sanvello provides.</p>
            <p><em>Winner:</em> Depends on what you need. <em>Sanvello</em> for broad CBT curriculum. <em>Anxiety Loop</em> for focused anxiety-specific exercises without the overwhelm.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>👥 Professional Support</h3>
            <p><strong>Sanvello</strong> offers access to licensed therapists and coaches through their premium subscription. You can schedule sessions, message your coach, and get professional guidance—all within the app. Some employers and insurance plans even cover Sanvello access.</p>
            <p><strong>Anxiety Loop</strong> is explicitly not a therapy or medical app. It's a wellness companion for tracking. If you need professional support, you'd use Anxiety Loop alongside separate therapy, not instead of it.</p>
            <p><em>Winner: Sanvello</em> — for users who want integrated professional support. But remember: Anxiety Loop never claimed to offer this.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>⏱️ Daily Interaction</h3>
            <p><strong>Anxiety Loop:</strong> 2 seconds. Open, tap your anxiety level, done. The app respects your time and doesn't ask for more than necessary.</p>
            <p><strong>Sanvello:</strong> More variable. A quick mood check takes seconds, but the app encourages engagement with lessons, journaling, and community. You might spend 5-20 minutes if you dive into content. This can be good (more tools) or overwhelming (more pressure).</p>
            <p><em>Winner:</em> Depends on what you want. <em>Anxiety Loop</em> for minimal friction. <em>Sanvello</em> for a more immersive experience.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>📊 Understanding Your Patterns</h3>
            <p><strong>Anxiety Loop</strong> is purpose-built for pattern recognition. The simple 4-level system (Calm, Elevated, Anxious, Overwhelmed) makes trends obvious. Weekly and monthly views show when anxiety tends to spike. The simplicity makes patterns easy to spot.</p>
            <p><strong>Sanvello</strong> includes mood tracking and health insights, but pattern analysis isn't its core strength. The app does more things, so no single feature gets as much focus. You'll see mood data, but in a more cluttered context.</p>
            <p><em>Winner: Anxiety Loop</em> — if pattern recognition is your primary goal.</p>

            <h3>🌬️ In-The-Moment Help</h3>
            <p>Both apps offer breathing exercises and calming tools. <strong>Anxiety Loop's</strong> breathing feature is immediately accessible—designed for when you need quick relief.</p>
            <p><strong>Sanvello</strong> has more variety: guided meditations, soundscapes, multiple breathing exercises, and grounding techniques. More options, but also more to navigate when you're already anxious.</p>
            <p><em>Winner: Tie</em> — Sanvello has more options; Anxiety Loop has faster access. Depends on whether variety or speed matters more to you.</p>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h3>👥 Community & Social</h3>
            <p><strong>Sanvello</strong> has a peer community where users can share experiences, offer support, and connect with others facing similar challenges. For some, this connection is incredibly valuable.</p>
            <p><strong>Anxiety Loop</strong> is strictly solo. No community, no sharing, no social features. Your tracking is private and personal.</p>
            <p><em>Winner:</em> Depends on preference. <em>Sanvello</em> if community support helps you. <em>Anxiety Loop</em> if you prefer solitude and privacy.</p>

            <h3>Our Honest Take</h3>
            <p>Sanvello and Anxiety Loop aren't really competitors—they're different categories of app.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 16px;"><strong>Sanvello</strong> is trying to be your complete mental health solution. It's ambitious and feature-rich. For people who want guided content, CBT exercises, community support, and even professional therapy access in one place, Sanvello delivers. The tradeoff is complexity, subscription costs, and data privacy concerns.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 16px;"><strong>Anxiety Loop</strong> is intentionally minimal. It does one thing—anxiety tracking—and does it well. The simplicity is the feature. For people who already have a therapist, or who just want to understand their patterns without committing to another comprehensive platform, Anxiety Loop is refreshingly focused.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 16px;">If you're struggling and need structured support, Sanvello (or a real therapist) is probably more appropriate. If you want a simple awareness tool to complement other resources, Anxiety Loop fits perfectly.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 16px;">Privacy-conscious users should note: this isn't close. Anxiety Loop's on-device architecture means your anxiety data stays yours. Sanvello requires cloud storage by design.</p>
