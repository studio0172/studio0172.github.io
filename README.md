# LabGuard HQ Website

This repository contains the LabGuard HQ website.

## Version Management

- `index.html` is always the live website that gets deployed
- Files named like `index_v1.html`, `index_v2.html`, etc. are historical versions of the website
- When making major changes, rename the current `index.html` to `index_vX.html` to preserve history before creating the new version

## Development

To make changes to the website:
1. Clone this repository
2. Edit the files as needed
3. Test locally by opening `index.html` in a browser
4. Commit and push changes to deploy to the live site
